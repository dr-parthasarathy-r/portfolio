    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a Physicist by training but I am passionate about a lot of other things as well, in fact I am fond of far too many things for my own good. I hold a PhD in Physics from a reputed, top-ranked Central
    Univesity in India. After my PhD, I carreid out my post-doctoral research over the next 2.5 years at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. I have taught for about 5 years at a reputed private university first and at at a CBSE school later. I took a break
    from regular employment to take care of my child in 2021. During free time, I have been keeping myself busy by running my YouTube channel, by providing affordable home tuitions to under-privileged kids in my locality, by learning to code, by building web sites, by learning to do data analysis  etc.,.
    Python has been my go-to programming language in the last few years.
