### Research highlights

YBCO superconductors are one of the most employable high Tc superconducting
materials with a lot of application potential across  a wide-variety of domains.
The fundamental understanding into the role of Ag doping in the YBCO/Ag
composite is changing and new insights have been obtained. Ag doping has an
additional role apart from the enhancement of mechanical properties in the
material. YBCO/Ag composites can have superior current-carrying and other
superconducting properties expected of such bulk materials. The YBCO/Ag
composites were prepared using a sophisticated Infiltration and Growth
Processing (IGP) technique which is based on the Melt Growth Processing (MGP)
technique and it is known to produce superior bulk superconducting samples. The
physical property changes with varying Ag has been studied in detail in this
work. The bulk samples were studied in great detail using a number of
characterization methods starting from levitation force measurements on full
bulk samples, temperature dependence of resistivity, AC susceptibility as a
function of temperature, microstructure analysis using optical and electron
microscopes, mechanical strength using nano-indentation studies etc. The
detailed analysis led to the following conclusions.

1) Distribution of silver as precipitates in the bulk matrix is hard to control.
2) Uniform distribution of silver plays a significant role in enhancing the
mechanical, electrical and magnetic properties of the superconductors. 3) Silver
plays an important role in the microstructure control of the material. 4) There
is an optimum level of silver addition that leads to enhancement of the desired
properties and beyond the optimum level the role of silver  is minimum.

Another important result of the PhD work is the observation of near-oscillatory
relaxation behavior of the levitation forces. This was an unreported observation
and a theoretical model was proposed to explain the observed behavior.

During my Post-doctoral work from one of the prestigious IITs in India, I worked
on novel superconducting materials and studying the physics of these Materials
through structural and other physical propery Investigations.
I also worked on nanomaterials for enhanced photocatalytic activity.
A significant result of this work was identifying dominant crystal facets that
enhance photocatalytic activity in nanostructures.
